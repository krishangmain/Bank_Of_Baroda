## Security Considerations

### Data Encryption
- Encrypt data at rest using Azure Storage Service Encryption with Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys
- Ensure data is encrypted in transit by enforcing HTTPS for all communications with our blob storage account

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Use Azure MFA to authenticate users using two or more verification methods
- This two-layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access as an attacker would need to bypass two layers of authentication

### Rate Limiting
- Implement a rate limiter for the API to ensure protection against DDOS attacks
- This ensures the integrity of the API and reduces the chances of a total server outage

### Firewall Protection
- Use the Azure firewall to protect our Azure Virtual Network resources
- Provide centralized protection by enforcing our security policies and logging all traffic
- Filter outbound and inbound traffic to ensure only legitimate traffic reaches our site
